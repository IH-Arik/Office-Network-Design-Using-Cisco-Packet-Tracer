## 🌐 Network Architecture

### Key Components
- **Core Layer**: High-performance switches and routers
- **Distribution Layer**: Layer 3 switches for routing between VLANs
- **Access Layer**: Edge switches for end-device connectivity
- **Security**: Firewall implementation and ACL configurations

### Network Segments
- Management VLAN
- Employee VLAN
- Guest VLAN
- Server VLAN
- DMZ

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Cisco Packet Tracer 7.0 or higher
- Basic networking knowledge
- Understanding of VLANs and routing protocols

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IH-Arik/Office-Network-Design-Using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer.git
   ```

2. Open the Packet Tracer file:
   ```
   Office System Network Design.pkt
   ```

3. Review the documentation in the `docs/` folder
